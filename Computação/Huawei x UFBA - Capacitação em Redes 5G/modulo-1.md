# Introdução, desenvolvimento e Evolução do 5G
## 1.1 Basics of mobile communications 
Communications -> Process of exchanging information
5G means fifth-generation and it's the extension of 4G. In wireless communications, eletromagnetic
waves are used to transmit information. C = λ x f
C -> lightspeed
λ -> wavelength of radio waves, in meters
f -> frequency, in Hz 
How is the network that can carry services of hundreds of millions of users around the world?
It consists of five parts: 
1. terminal : mobile phone, cpe, drone -- connected to antennas on base stations  
2. base station -> connected to each users around it
3. transport network -- sends information to the core network 
4. core network -- sends the requests to the relevant application  
5. application service -- provides the service itself  
## 1.2 Driving force of 5G development
"4G changes our life while 5G  changes the entire society" 
some examples of tech that aren't fully usable only with 4G, but are real possibilities with 5G: 
- augmented reality 
- virtual reality 
- cloud gaming 
- cloud office 
- remote surgery 
- autonomous driving
