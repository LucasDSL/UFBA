# Introdução, desenvolvimento e Evolução do 5G
## 1.1 Basics of mobile communications 
Communications -> Process of exchanging information
5G means fifth-generation and it's the extension of 4G. In wireless communications, eletromagnetic
waves are used to transmit information. C = λ x f
C -> lightspeed
λ -> wavelength of radio waves, in meters
f -> frequency, in Hz 
How is the network that can carry services of hundreds of millions of users around the world?
It consists of five parts: 
1. terminal : mobile phone, cpe, drone -- connected to antennas on base stations  
2. base station -> connected to each users around it
3. transport network -- sends information to the core network 
4. core network -- sends the requests to the relevant application  
5. application service -- provides the service itself  
## 1.2 Driving force of 5G development
"4G changes our life while 5G  changes the entire society" 
some examples of tech that aren't fully usable only with 4G, but are real possibilities with 5G: 
- augmented reality 
- virtual reality 
- cloud gaming 
- cloud office 
- remote surgery 
- autonomous driving 
## 1.3 5G Standarlization Progress  
3GPP was supposed to standarlize the process of 5g development on two phases on separate parts of its releases 
but verizon announced the establishment of OTSA to formulate unified
specifications for 5G tests, promote the allocation of 28 GHz spectrum resources, and
promote the development of the 5G industry. Then 3GPP accelerated its process and made it as follow: 
Phase 1 completed in the middle of 2018 implements
eMBB and basic URLLC services. Phase 2, that is, 3GPP Release 16, completes URLLC services
and enhances eMBB. mMTC was considered in the initial phase.
## 1.4 5G Industry Chain and Ecosystem
Both ecosystem and network deployment must be simplifiend in 5G technologies. There
### 1.4.1
There are several types of 5G terminals, the most common being the CPEs and 
MiFi
CPE: provides stable Wi-Fi coverage
MiFi: can convert ubiquitous 5G network signals into high-speed personal hotspot signals
This chapter also explains how are communications frequencies divided in china. 
## 1.5 Global 5G Commercial Use
In the beggining
- device monitoring 
- campus inspection 
- live and mobile video 
In the second phase: 
- facial recognition
- remote driving 
- power distribution automation 
- remote B-scan inspection 
the third phase involves: 
- advanced control and massive connections 
- personal smart wearables 
- smart homes 
- self driving cars 
- smart lamp poles 
- motion control
